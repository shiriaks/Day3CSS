                <strong>HTML</strong> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
                With HTML constructs, <i>images</i> and other objects such as <i>interactive forms</i> may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
                HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>

                surround and provide information about document text <i>and</i> may include other tags as sub-elements. <br>

                Most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to provide formatting<br> and semantic markup not available with plain text.<br> This may include typographic information like coloured headings, emphasized and quoted text, inline images and diagrams.
